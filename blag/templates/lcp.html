<p>
    I collect peaks, this is my list. Note that my definition of "peak" here is gratuitious, I've included both hills, almost-reached-the-summit adventures, and needles without a name on the map. The point is the joy of discovery and adventure and getting out, it's not a competition. Collecting motivates me to do more and go new places.
